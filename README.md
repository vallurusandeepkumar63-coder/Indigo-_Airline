**Project Theme:**

The project theme is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Airline Reviews. It focuses on analyzing customer feedback across various airlines (such as Turkish Airlines, Qatar Airways, and Alitalia) to understand traveler satisfaction and the factors influencing their recommendations.


**Project Summary:**

The project utilizes a dataset containing 40,000 airline reviews collected between July 2014 and May 2019. It aims to identify patterns in customer experiences by examining multiple service dimensions—such as seat comfort, cabin service, and food quality—to determine what drives a "recommended" status from a traveler.

**Project Details:**

Dataset Source: The data is loaded from an Excel file named data_airline_reviews_1.xlsx.

Key Data Columns: The analysis tracks several metrics, including:

Core Info: Airline name, overall rating, author, and review date.

Travel Details: Aircraft type, traveler type (e.g., Business, Family Leisure), cabin class, and flight route.

Service Ratings: Individual scores (1–5) for seat comfort, cabin service, food/beverages, entertainment, and ground service.

Outcome: Value for money and whether the user recommended the airline.

Tools Used: The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and seaborn/matplotlib for data visualization.

**Data Characteristics:**

The dataset includes 17 unique airlines.

Overall ratings range from 1 to 10, with an average standard deviation of approximately 3.51.

Traveler types are categorized into four main groups: Business, Couple Leisure, Family Leisure, and Solo Leisure.
